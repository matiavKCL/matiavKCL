I work as Senior Lecturer in Public Policy at the Department of Political Economy, King's College London, where I served as the programme director of the Master of Arts in Public Policy (here is my KCL page).  I work as Field Editor (European Public Policy) for the Journal of  Public Policy (Cambridge University Press). I am also an Institutional Grammar Research Initiative (IGRI) Affiliate and Political Economics of Reforms, Institutional Complexity, and Legislative Evaluation Studies (PERICLES) Fellow.

From November 2016 to August 2018, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Innocenzo Gasparini Institute for Economic Research (IGIER), Bocconi University, where I worked on a project which uses advanced text analysis (based on computational linguistics) to study delegation, legislative complexity ,and economic growth.

I am also working on other topics: text mining for policy evaluation; business and government in the European Union; public policy and public opinion; representation and transparency in local democracies. I have been involved in several cross-country research projects, funded by the European Research Council, the British Academy and the Economic and Social Research Council. My research has featured in several journals, such as Political Analysis, Business and Society, ARPA, PSRM, JPART, PSJ, EJPR and JEPP, and my manuscript is published by Oxford University Press (another one is forthcoming with Edward Elgar Publishing).

I did my PhD at UCL (awarded in February 2017), I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s Degree in political science from the University of Trento and an MRes from the LSE
